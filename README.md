### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**BruceLau9805/BruceLau9805** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ I am currently a phd student. 
- ðŸŒ± The research directions of mine generally include the speech and audio signal processing, especially the microphone array signal processing and multi-media communication system.
- ðŸ‘¯ My works can be separated as therotical research on Front-end acoustic algorithms and Engineering application development.
- ðŸ¤” All of these works bring me good abilities to do signal processing, algorithm designing, and engineering programming. but it's not good enough for me, it's my target to solve the actual problems and make some innovations in the next few years. And i will focus on the study of array signal processing with the fusion of neural networks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about speech and audio signal processing, especially the microphone array signal processing and multi-media communication system.
